        <h1>Women Change the World</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In the previous chapter, we saw how household work, often unrecognized as work, is a continuous full-time responsibility. It delves into gender biases in occupations, the importance of education for women, and the efforts of the women's movement to challenge discrimination.
        </p>

        <h2>Perceived Occupational Gender Roles</h2>
        <p>
            1. Gender stereotypes limit career choices, with the belief that women excel in nurturing roles like nursing and men in technical roles like the army.
            <br> 2. These stereotypes can hinder girls' opportunities to pursue careers in fields like medicine and engineering.
            <br> 3. Social pressures often encourage girls to prioritize marriage over further education and professional aspirations.
        </p>

        <h2>Pressures on Children in Society</h2>
        <p>
            1. Children face various societal pressures, including expectations from adults and teasing from peers.
            <br> 2. Boys often feel pressured to pursue high-paying jobs and conform to traditional male behavior, facing teasing if they deviate from these norms.
            <br> 3. Early conditioning discourages boys from openly expressing emotions, like crying, in front of others.
        </p>

        <h2>Breaking Stereotypes: Laxmi Lakra's Inspiring Journey</h2>
        <p>
            1. Laxmi Lakra, hailing from a poor tribal family in Jharkhand, shattered gender stereotypes by becoming the first female engine driver for Northern Railways.
            <br> 2. Despite facing numerous challenges, Laxmi's parents prioritized education, allowing her to excel in school and earn a diploma in electronics.
            <br> 3. Laxmi's determination and love for challenges motivated her to pursue traditionally male-dominated fields, including becoming an engine driver.
            <br> 4. Her philosophy centers around leading a fulfilling life of her choice as long as it brings joy, doesn't harm anyone, and supports her family.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning for Change: Transforming Education Norms</h2>
        <p>
            1. Historically, education and learning were limited to a select few, with most children acquiring skills related to their family's work.
            <br> 2. Girls, in particular, faced severe limitations in accessing education and learning opportunities.
            <br> 3. The nineteenth century marked a significant shift with the emergence of new ideas about education, leading to the opening of schools in communities previously deprived of such opportunities.
            <br> 4. Despite opposition, both women and men championed efforts to establish schools for girls and struggled to attain literacy and education.
        </p>

        <h2>The Remarkable Journey of Rashsundari Devi</h2>
        <p>
            1. Born in West Bengal, Rashsundari Devi, a housewife, challenged societal norms that discouraged women from reading and writing.
            <br> 2. Despite these norms, she secretly taught herself to read and write.
            <br> 3. Her journey began at fourteen with a strong desire to read a religious manuscript.
            <br> 4. She became the first Indian woman to write an autobiography, titled "Amar Jiban."
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges in Gender Disparities in Education</h2>
        <p>
            1. While both boys and girls attend school in significant numbers today, disparities in the quality of education and access to schooling persist.
            <br> 2. Census data reveals that despite progress, there are still significant differences in literacy rates between boys and girls. In the 2011 census, 82% of boys and men were literate, compared to 65% of girls and women.
            <br> 3. This gender gap in literacy continues to be a concern, indicating that more boys receive adequate education compared to girls.
            <br> 4. The 2011 census also highlighted that Muslim girls were less likely to complete primary school compared to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) girls, with various reasons for children dropping out, including the lack of nearby schools, transportation, and discrimination.
            <br> 5. Discrimination against marginalized communities such as Dalit, Adivasi, and Muslim children further contributes to the disparities in educational opportunities and access, making it essential to address these issues for a more equitable education system.
