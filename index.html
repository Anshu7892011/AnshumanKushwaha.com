    <h1>Women Change the World</h1>

    <!-- Chapter 1 -->
    <h2>Women's Change the World</h2>
    <p>In the previous chapter, we saw how women’s work in the home is not recognised as work. We also read how doing household work and taking care of family members is a full-time job and there are no specific hours at which it begins or ends. In this chapter, we will look at work outside the home, and understand how some occupations are seen to be more suitable for men than for women. We will also learn about how women struggle for equality. Getting an education was, and still is, one way in which new opportunities were created for women. This chapter will also briefly trace the different types of efforts made by the women’s movement to challenge discrimination in more recent years.</p>

    <h2>Fewer Opportunities and Rigid Expectations</h2>
    <p>A lot of the children in Rosie Ma’am’s class drew women as nurses and men as army officers. The reason they did this is because they feel that outside the home too, women are good at only certain jobs. For example, many people believe that women make better nurses because they are more patient and gentle. This is linked to women’s roles within the family. Similarly, it is believed that science requires a technical mind and girls and women are not capable of dealing with technical things. Because so many people believe in these stereotypes, many girls do not get the same support that boys do to study and train to become doctors and engineers. In most families, once girls finish school, they are encouraged by their families to see marriage as their main aim in life.</p>

    <h2>Pressures on Boys</h2>
    <p>It is important to understand that we live in a society in which all children face pressures from the world around them. Sometimes, these come in the form of demands from adults. At other times, they can just be because of unfair teasing by our own friends. Boys are pressurised to think about getting a job that will pay a good salary. They are also teased and bullied if they do not behave like other boys. You may remember that in your Class VI book you read about how boys at an early age are encouraged not to cry in front of others.</p>

    <h2>Breaking Stereotypes</h2>
    <p>Engine drivers are men. But 27-year-old Laxmi Lakra, from a poor tribal family in Jharkhand, has begun to change things. She is the first woman engine driver for Northern Railways. Laxmi’s parents are not literate but they struggled and overcame many hardships to make sure their children got an education. Laxmi studied in a government school. Even in school, Laxmi helped with the housework and did odd jobs. She studied hard and did well and then went on to get a diploma in electronics. She then took the railway board exam and passed it on her first attempt. Laxmi says, “I love challenges and the moment somebody says it is not for girls, I make sure I go ahead and do it.”</p>

    <h2>Learning for Change</h2>
    <p>Going to school is an extremely important part of your life. As more and more children enter school every year, we begin to think that it is normal for all children to go to school. Today, it is difficult for us to imagine that school and learning could be seen as “out of bounds” or not appropriate for some children. But in the past, the skill of reading and writing was known to only a few. Most children learned the work their families or elders did. For girls, the situation was worse. In communities that taught sons to read and write, daughters were not allowed to learn the alphabet. Even in families where skills like pottery, weaving, and craft were taught, the contribution of daughters and women was only seen as supportive.</p>

    <h2>Pandita Ramabai</h2>
    <p>Pandita Ramabai was a notable Indian scholar, social reformer, and advocate for women's rights in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Here are three key points about her:
    1. **Women's Education Advocate:** Pandita Ramabai promoted women's education through the Sharada Sadan school in Pune, emphasizing literacy and empowerment.
    2. **Widow Welfare Champion:** She founded Arya Mahila Samaj in 1882 to support and educate widows, addressing their challenging conditions in society.
    3. **Interfaith Reformer:** While she converted to Christianity, Ramabai focused on broader social and religious reform, addressing issues of inequality and gender discrimination.</p>

    <h2>Schooling and Education Today</h2>
    <p>Today, both boys and girls attend school in large numbers. Yet, as we will see, there still remain differences between the education of boys and girls. India has a census every 10 years, which counts the whole population of the country. It also gathers detailed information about the people living in India – their age, schooling, what work they do, and so on. We use this information to measure many things, like the number of literate people, and the ratio of men and women. According to the 1961 census, about 40 per cent of all boys and men (7 years old and above) were literate (that is, they could at least write their names) compared to just 15 per cent of all girls and women. In the most recent census of 2011, these figures have grown to 82 per cent for boys and men, and 65 per cent for girls and women. This means that the proportion of both men and women who are now able to read and have at least some amount of schooling has increased. But, as you can also see, the percentage of the male group is still higher than the female group. The gap has not gone away. The 2011 census also found that Muslim girls are less likely, than SC and ST girls, to complete primary school. While a Muslim girl is likely to stay in school for around three years, girls from other communities spend around four years in school. There are several reasons why children from Dalit, Adivasi, and Muslim communities leave school. In many parts of the country, especially in rural and poor areas, there may not even be proper schools nor teachers who teach on a regular basis. If a school is not close to people’s homes, and there is no transport like buses or vans, parents may not be willing to send their girls to school. Many families are too poor and unable to bear the cost of educating all their children. Boys may get preference in this situation. Many children also leave school because they are discriminated against by their teacher and classmates.</p>

    <h2>Women’s Movement</h2>
    <p>Women and girls now have the right to study and go to school. There are other spheres – like legal reform, violence and health – where the situation of women and girls has improved. These changes have not happened automatically. Women individually, and collectively have struggled to bring about these changes. This struggle is known as the Women’s Movement. Individual women and women’s organisations from different parts of the country are part of the movement. Many men support the women’s movement as well. The diversity, passion and efforts of those involved make it a very vibrant movement. Different strategies have been used to spread awareness, fight discrimination and seek justice.</p>
